Debug a Donation Form
A local charity has built a donation form website, but there are several issues that need to be fixed. The form isn't accessible and has some HTML syntax errors.

Your job is to fix all of the errors so the form works correctly and is accessible to all users. Complete the items in the user stories below and click "Run the Tests" to see if you fixed all the errors.

User Stories:

The input elements are void elements and should not have closing tags. Remove all </input> closing tags from the form.
Add label elements for each form input field so users know what each field is for. The label text should match what's currently next to each input.
The Email Address: input type should be an email instead of text.
You should associate each label element with its corresponding input element using the for attribute on the label and a matching id attribute on the input.
Add the required attribute to the text, email, and number input fields (but not the checkbox or submit button) to ensure users fill in the required information.
